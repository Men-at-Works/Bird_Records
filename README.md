# Bird Records
***You add positions; I draw them!***

**This is orginally for our project of NASA Hackerthon 2017.** The Shiny app allows users to add geographical positions (longitude and latitude). It will then append one record in the csv file and show the yellow dots in an interactive way.

PS: The lonlat.csv should be put in a "data" subfolder.
